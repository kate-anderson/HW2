	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hello! My name is Kate and I am a senior majoring in Information Systems while working towards a Computer Science minor. I am a member of the 
	Sailing Club and Team, HackIowa, and Tippie Technology and Innovation Association. I am also an alumna of Alpha Delta Pi Sorority. In addition to my 
	love for coding and technology, I also love being outside. Some of my favorite activities include sailing, splunking, hiking, paddle boarding, and 
	camping. I am always up for a new adventure. I also love traveling, photography, and visiting family and friends. </p>
